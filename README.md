# Non-JUPAS Admission System  
**Course Project – COMP4117 Information Systems: Design and Integration**  
Jan 2026 – Apr 2026 (anticipated)

Web-based system to support university admission decisions for non-JUPAS applicants.  
The platform helps admission officers compare and rank applicants more efficiently by normalizing academic performance (GPA) and presenting structured profile data.

## My Role – Project Lead & Full-Stack Developer

I served as **project lead** for a team of 4–5 students and contributed equally as a full-stack developer.

### Project Lead & Governance
- Architected sprint timeline and major deliverables across the semester
- Maintained code quality and repository hygiene through consistent Pull Request reviews and merge discipline
- Managed team expectations, conflict resolution, and progress transparency

### Operational Flow & Coordination
- Created and maintained the central **team tracking Google Sheet** ("Team Jobs") with columns:  
  Member | Front-End Task | Back-End Task | Feature | Status (To Do / In Progress / Done)  
- Added weekly sections: **Goals this week**, **Internal deadlines**, **Next client meeting**, **Notes for this week**, **Sequential process for this week**
- Set up and actively managed a **WhatsApp group** for daily communication and quick decisions
- Created and maintained a **Google Doc** for major decisions, tech stack rationale, and meeting notes
- Regularly checked in with teammates, notified them of important decisions, and kept everyone aligned

### Technical Contributions
- **Full-stack development**: built both front-end and back-end features (roughly equal contribution)
- Designed and implemented the **MongoDB student collection schema** (core data model for applicant profiles)
- Defined and enforced the **tech stack**; documented rationale in shared Google Doc and required team to reference it only  
  → **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript  
  → **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
  → **Database**: MongoDB  
  → **Other tools**: Git, VS Code
- Led development of the **GPA normalization algorithm** (back-end feature)  
  → Standardizes GPAs from different grading systems / institutions  
  → Enables fairer, faster comparison when deciding which students to shortlist / interview
- Translated complex admission requirements into functional code together with the team

### Development Approach
- Mostly **vibe-coded** with heavy use of **Claude Haiku** (and occasionally GitHub Copilot) as a coding assistant  
- I personally reviewed, debugged, tested and adapted every piece of generated code  
- All final logic, structure and decisions were understood and owned by me

## Tech Stack Summary
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap 5), JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Version Control**: Git (GitHub)  
- **Collaboration**: Google Sheets, Google Docs, WhatsApp

## Acknowledgments
This was a team project. I want to thank my teammates for their hard work on both front-end and back-end implementation.

Special thanks to the course instructor and our client (simulated admission officer role) for feedback and real-world requirements.

**Note for interviewers / admission committees**  
This project demonstrates my ability to lead a team, maintain structure under time pressure, communicate decisions clearly, enforce technical consistency, and deliver functional full-stack features — skills I believe are valuable in both academic and professional environments.
